The function to monitor the four engines so that they don't collide is done in it's own task. Once every second the fucntion runs. It first gets the positions of all four of the motors. New left and right maximum positions are set for each of the four motors. The leftmost bound for motor #1 is always the minimum possible position, and the rightmost bound for motor #4 is always the maximum possible position. Otherwise, bounds for each motor is the halfway point between the motor and its neighboring motor. This insures that each motor will have room to move, but will never be able to collide with its neighbor. Because the motors are moving, the left and right limits for each motor are changing every second. For example, if motor #1 is at postion 2, motor #2 is at position 8, and motor #3 is at postion 20, then the left bound for motor #2 is 5 (halfway between 2 and 8) and the right bound for motor #2 is 14 (halfway between 8 and 20).
